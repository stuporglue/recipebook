recipebook
==========

A PHP recipe book for my wife's recipes

Features 
--------

* Support for sub-recipes (eg. for sauces or whatever)
* LibreOffice Base front-end for easily loading in data (coming soon) 
* HTML5 responsive desing (coming soonish)
* Instructions support Markdown
* Fractions look like fractions

Known Issues
------------

* I mis-spelled recipe_recipe in the table name as recpie_recipe. This will be fixed soon

Quirks
------

These aren't bugs, these are design decisions to make things easier

* Ingredient quantities are entered as decimals. Use 0.33 for 1/3 and 0.66 for 2/3
* All ingredients must have a unit. Use count for things like eggs or whole fruits which shouldn't display a unit
