        <h1>Caroline's Favorite Recipes</h1>
        <p>
            Everyone knows Caroline is an amazing cook. No recipe is too daunting 
            too tricky if it promises to be delicious. And sure, there are a few of us who 
            haven't forgotten the veggie-pizza incident of 2004, but by and large Caroline's
            magical sixth sense of deliciousness leads her to meals and deserts that everyone loves.
        </p>
        <p>
            These are Caroline's tried-and-true recipes. These are the ones that she has made again and again
            and decided that they're worth keeping around. 
        </p>
        <p>
            They come from all over. Some are traditional family recipes, others from 
            friends, or discovered during the Walton and Moore family travels.  
            Some were even just found online and adopted over time.
            Wherever they came from though, you can be sure they're good.
